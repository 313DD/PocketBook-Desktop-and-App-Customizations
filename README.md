After much colobaration with users on Mobile Read on this thread https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=355521, we all found a way to customize the PocketBook desktop, app icons, app name and app drawer layout

This was tested(on my end) with a PocketBook Era on SW Version 6.8(Latest). Another user on the thread had SW Version 5.2 with a PocketBook touch HD which appeared to work differently then what I needed to do

The prupose of this repo is to summarize these finding into an easy to follow guide.

This doesn't require root, just the ability to understand File System and JSON

## Changing app names
